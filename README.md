# xored_pets
Original code from https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/

Training  ~3000 Cats & 3000 Dogs pix

It was an idea to check training process on changed images
Original pixels were masked by nearest pixel (right & down) - XOR operation

One pix set was XORed 100%, second - half, by 50% RGB value of near pixel
